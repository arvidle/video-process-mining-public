# README

## TODO

The README will be updated in the following days to include information on the requirements and usage of the implementation.

We will also provide instructions to fit the implementation to a custom use case.

## Data availability

The training datasets, weights of finetuned models and inference results for the five days selected for the case study are available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7763838
These provided zipfile needs to be unpacked in the root directory of this repository.
